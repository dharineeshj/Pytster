# Pytster

Pytster is an application designed to check whether a given hash, email address, IPv4 address, URL, or domain is malicious. Additionally, it provides detailed information about the input by consolidating data from various OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) websites. This tool simplifies the work of analysts by aggregating information in one place.

- Retrieve detailed information from various OSINT websites.
- User-friendly GUI implemented using the QT framework with C++.
- It provides information in json, pdf and text format.

## How it Works

Pytster utilizes API requests to interact with different OSINT websites, collecting valuable information. The tool is built in Python and appliaction of this tool is built in QT framework, leveraging the `requests` module for API interactions. The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using the QT framework with C++ as the underlying programming language.
